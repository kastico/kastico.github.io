## 💭 What is *Cracking the Code*?

The code for what, you ask?

For me — it’s the code for a better life.  
Becoming a better person and professional.  
Trying to achieve my dreams while staying happy doing it.

I kind of know where I’m heading, but not all the answers — and that’s the fun part.  
I feel this *drive* inside, but sometimes I forget I can actually do it. I struggle to start, but once I do, I can deliver every piece of me into something.  
Sometimes it’s toxic for me or others… sorry for that. It’s never on purpose — I just tend to pour all my focus into work or a hobby because I want to be the best version of myself.

My brain doesn’t stop. It keeps thinking about what I’ve learned, what I can improve, what’s next.

Writing helps me slow that chaos down.  
It’s easier to understand myself when I’m not thinking and writing at the same time.  
That’s why this space exists — to share what I learn, what I build, and how I feel while doing it.

I want to keep a record of my progress — and of my struggles — and try to stay consistent.  
For me, that’s **part one of cracking the code:** Drive and Consistency.

## 🧱 The Foundation

At this point, I’m 24 years old — 20 of those spent in front of a computer.  
Gaming, coding, producing, designing…

Cliché, right? But true.

I was a shy kid. My older brother and cousins were my world, but most of the time I was just… with the computer.  
When my parents bought one for the house, I had no idea what it was — but I was instantly hooked. A few months later, if something went wrong, everyone would just say:  
> “Ask António.”

I also had a PS2 (still do) — that was my gateway to gaming.

And honestly, even before that, I was obsessed with **customization**.  
I remember illegally downloading *GTA Vice City* and discovering forums full of modders. I loved it — the idea that you could change something big and make it your own.  
That’s where it started.  
I was like 8 or 9, tweaking textures and replacing car models. The design side came naturally; I liked transforming images and skins.

Even today, I’m still obsessed with customizing everything — my terminal, my editor, my OS.  
It doesn’t make me a better programmer, but it makes me feel *at home*.

> 💻 I’m a terminal guy.  
> GUI? Nice to have.  
> But the terminal? That’s power. You won’t change my mind.

## 🧬 Bio

**Name:** António Barbosa  
**From:** Portugal 🇵🇹  
**Age:** 24  
**Education:**  
- Degree in **Graphic Design** from *ESAD.CR* (Caldas da Rainha)  
- Programming Course at *CENCAL*  

**Currently:** Software Developer at a small company building its own business maintenance software.  
My focus is improving UI/UX and creating a cohesive visual identity across products — but being a small team, I end up doing a bit of everything. Backend, UI, deployment… it’s all part of the fun.  

I think that’s the best way to start a career — learning everything, building versatility, and understanding the full stack of how things work.

## 🧠 Languages & Tools

### 🗣️ Programming
C · C# · Java · Python · HTML/CSS ·  
C++ / QML (Qt Framework) · JavaScript · Zig · Bash  

I mainly use **C++ with Qt** at work, building both QWidget and QML-based UIs.  
Our backend is in C++ and we use **PostgreSQL / SQLite** for data.  

Lately, I’ve been exploring **Zig** — I love its syntax and philosophy.  
Also diving deeper into JavaScript frameworks (slowly learning to love them 😅).  

### ⚙️ Technologies
Docker · Kubernetes · Git · GitHub Actions · Pipelines ·  
Figma (UX/UI) · Kafka · Yocto · Linux · Neovim · Terminal life

## 🧠 Why this space exists

This site — *The Bunker* — is my digital shelter.  
A place to store knowledge, projects, thoughts, and experiments.  
A collection of **vaults** — each one focused on a part of what I love: design, development, music, and more.

This is where I’ll write, build, and refine my craft.  
Sometimes code. Sometimes feelings.  
But always with intent.

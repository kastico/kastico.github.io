### Who? 

**Name:** António Barbosa  
**From:** Portugal 🇵🇹  
**Age:** 25  
**Education:**  
- Degree in **Graphic Design** from *ESAD.CR* (Caldas da Rainha)  
- Programming Course at *CENCAL*  

**Currently:** Software Developer at a small company building its own business maintenance software.  
My focus is improving UI/UX and creating a cohesive visual identity across products — but being a small team, I end up doing a bit of everything. Backend, UI, deployment… it’s all part of the fun.  

I think that’s the best way to start a career — learning everything, building versatility, and understanding the full stack of how things work.

### 🧱 The Foundation

At this point, I’m 24 years old — 20 of those spent in front of a computer.  
Gaming, coding, producing, designing…

Cliché, right? But true.

I was a shy kid. My older brother and cousins were my world, but most of the time I was just… with the computer.  
When my parents bought one for the house, I had no idea what it was — but I was instantly hooked. A few months later, if something went wrong, everyone would just say:  
    -“Ask António.”

I also had a PS2 (still do) — that was my gateway to gaming.

And honestly, even before that, I was obsessed with **customization**.  
I remember illegally downloading *GTA Vice City* and discovering forums full of modders. I loved it — the idea that you could change something big and make it your own.  
That’s where it started.  
I was like 8 or 9, tweaking textures and replacing car models. The design side came naturally; I liked transforming images and skins.

Even today, I’m still obsessed with customizing everything — my terminal, my editor, my OS.  
It doesn’t make me a better programmer, but it makes me feel *at home*.

I’m a terminal guy. GUI? Nice to have. But the terminal? That’s power. You won’t change my mind.

#### 🗣️ Programming
C · C# · Java · Python · HTML/CSS ·  
C++ / QML (Qt Framework) · JavaScript · Zig · Bash  

I mainly use **C++ with Qt** at work, building both QWidget and QML-based UIs.  
Our backend is in C++ and we use **PostgreSQL / SQLite** for data.  

Lately, I’ve been exploring **Zig** — I love its syntax and philosophy.  
Also diving deeper into JavaScript frameworks (slowly learning to love them 😅).

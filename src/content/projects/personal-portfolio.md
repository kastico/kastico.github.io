## About This Project

This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my projects, write blog posts, and share my journey as a developer. Built with Astro for optimal performance and great developer experience.

## The Beginning

This project was the start of my digital garden, as I mentioned in my foundational blog post:  
**[Opening The Vault](/blog/opening-the-vault/)**

## Technical Details

The website is built as a static site with Astro, which allows for incredibly fast loading times. I've implemented a custom dark/light theme system that persists user preferences.

## Key Features

- **Performance First**: Leveraging Astro's static site generation for optimal Core Web Vitals
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive across all device sizes
- **Accessibility**: Built with accessibility best practices in mind
- **SEO Optimized**: Proper meta tags and structured data

## What I Learned

This project taught me a lot about modern static site generators, performance optimization, and creating great user experiences. The component-based architecture with Astro made the development process smooth and enjoyable, and it became the foundation for my entire digital presence as described in [Opening The Vault](/blog/opening-the-vault/).

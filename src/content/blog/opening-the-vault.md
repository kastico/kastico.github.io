*What is cracking the code?*

The code for what? - You think.
Well for me the code for a better life, becoming a better person and professional. Trying to achieve my dreams staying happy doing it.
I know kinda where to go but i don't have all the answers. For me that's the fun part. 
I feel the drive inside me. but sometimes i just forget i can do it. I struggle to start but when i do i know i can deliver every little part of me on something. Kinda becoming sometimes toxic for me and other... Sorry for that. Is not on the mean part is just not giving the attention some people need. I just focus all of it in my job or hobby because i want to be the best. My brain can's stop thinking about the stuff i learned on the day and i want more and more.

I don't really have a reason for writing. I just feel that is easier for me to understand my head when i am not thinking at the same time. So when i write and then read i understand really what i want.

That's why i am creating this space. Not only to share and keep up with some notes on the stuff that i learn and i am curious about, but also to put my feeling and struggles in words.
I want to keep record of my progress and try to keep up it this good habit. 
For me this is part one on cracking the code. Drive and consistency.
I will try to post at least 2 times a week. One small post about the week and the struggles. And another one about something a learned on that week. I will leave examples and the links that i used if needed and share some of my code. 

**Let's crack the code!**

Where to start right?

At this time i have 25 years of life. 20 of that spend on front of a computer. Gaming, coding, producing, designing... 

Its cliche but also the truth. I was a shy kid. I had my older brother and my cousins but around from that i did not have no one. My brother was older and because of that we did not have so much in common. We are both nerds, but different kind of nerds. I remember that my parent bought a computer for the house. i didn't know what it was but i was amazed with that. I just spent hours there. Just clicking and finding stuff. After a couple of month at the house if you had a problem at the computer you just call'd me.  I also had a ps2 (that i still own) that introduced me to gaming. Those were the days... 


Even before i knew this type of environment i always loved to just customise and transform everything that the people gave to me. My love for this area started when i illegal download GTA Vice City. I found some forums and sites that made costume mods for the game. I loved that. The fact that you can put a part of you in a big game like that and exist a community that uses that was awesome. I was like 8/9 years old at that time. (Yeah i know, to young to play GTA, but i came about right... I think). I really, really put my head on this world. The part that was easier for my at the time was the design part. Transforming images. creating skins etc. I remember changing some variables on the code but always with small software that could easily do that stuff. 


Even today i am a little crazy about custom stuff. I like to rice up my setups. I know that at the end of the day it will not make my a better programmer but is just easier for my to feel at "home" when i have my custom setup.


I am a terminal guy. Really love the terminal. I know there is almost a GUI for everything but sometimes is just useless. You will not change my mind! Forget it.
